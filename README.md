### Project link: https://github.com/Jay0494/Jay-s-data-analysis-project

**Title and Brief Description:**
"Sales Analysis Dashboard: .This project analyzes car sales data from an American automotive business to identify the most profitable and highest-selling car models. The report highlights the top 10 car models by revenue, the bottom 10 by sales, and the top 10 by profit. Insights gained from this analysis inform strategic recommendations aimed at optimizing future sales efforts and enhancing profitability."

**Objective:**
"To provide a comprehensive view of sales performance and identify key trends to aid in strategic decision-making."

**Methodology:**
- Data Collection: The data was provided by the sales manager.
- Data Cleaning: Used Power query for data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Visualization: Developed interactive dashboards using Powerbi.

**Results:**
The financial overview shows a total revenue of **$11,968,694.69**, total profit of **$1,758,133.80**, and total expenses of **$15,977.00**. Key insights include:
- **Hyundai Tucson**: Consistently ranks as the top model across various years (2016-2018) in both revenue and profit, indicating strong market performance.
- **Luxury Models**: Models like the **Land Rover Discovery** and **Audi Q7** offer significant revenue and profit margins, highlighting a lucrative luxury segment.
- **Older Models**: Cars manufactured before 2015 are underperforming in sales, suggesting potential phasing out due to low demand.
- **Profitability vs. Sales Volume**: Models like the **Ford Fusion** maintain profitability despite lower sales, likely due to favorable cost structures or high-margin sales opportunities.

**Conclusion:**
"The dashboard provided valuable insights that helped the marketing team optimize their campaign strategies, resulting in a significant increase in ROI."






# Project 2: Enhancing customer service performance
### Project link: https://github.com/Jay0494/Omnipresent_project_on_forage

**Brief Description:**
Omnipresent's customer service center utilizes data visualizations to analyze key performance metrics such as average satisfaction ratings, answering speed, total calls resolved, and agent performance. Insights from the data reveal trends in call resolution, customer satisfaction, and call distribution throughout the day, aiding in performance optimization.

**Objective:**
The objectives include enhancing customer satisfaction by addressing feedback, optimizing call handling to reduce answering speed, evaluating agent performance for development, analyzing call patterns to improve staffing, and increasing first-contact resolution rates for better service effectiveness.

**Methodology:**
Using ETL:
- Data Collection: Extracted the data from forage.com .
- Data Cleaning: Processed and cleaned the data using power query.
- Loaded the cleaned data into Powerbi desktop

**Results:**
Key insights reveal that streaming and technical support requests are the most frequent, suggesting a need for additional resources in these areas. The highest call volume occurs in the afternoon, indicating a need for optimized staffing during peak times. The average satisfaction rating of 2.76 shows room for improvement through enhanced agent training and service processes. While the average call answering speed is reasonable at 54.75 seconds, reducing this time could further improve customer experience. Top agent Jim serves as a benchmark for performance enhancement across the team. Additionally, a call resolution rate of 72.92% and an 81.08% call answer rate demonstrate PhoneNow’s effectiveness in addressing customer inquiries.

**Recommendation:**
To enhance customer satisfaction, key strategies include analyzing feedback, improving agent training, and streamlining service processes for faster issue resolution. Optimizing staffing during peak periods involves adjusting staffing levels, implementing flexible schedules, and possibly hiring additional agents. To minimize call answering speed, investing in advanced call routing and considering part-time staff during busy times are recommended. Leveraging top agent performance, such as benchmarking Jim’s methods and establishing mentorship programs, can foster continuous improvement. Focusing on resolution rates includes enhancing the knowledge base, conducting regular performance reviews, and implementing incentives for high performance. Maintaining high call answer rates will require ongoing process optimization, robust monitoring, and offering callback options for customers during peak times.


# Project 3: Customer Churn
### Project Link: https://github.com/Jay0494/Customer-churn

**Brief description**
The project, initiated by the Freebies WhatsApp Group, aims to identify customers at risk of churning from Chinooks, a music streaming service. By analyzing cleaned and prepared customer, transaction, and behavioral data from the Chinooks Database, the team seeks to uncover trends and develop strategies to improve customer retention and loyalty. The ultimate goal is to enhance Chinooks' growth and stability by addressing potential churn proactively.

**Methodology**
- The data was provided as a zip file from which we extracted the relevant data.
- The major data cleaning process took place in Python using pandas.
- The cleaned data was then exported to powerbi for more processing and visualization

### Results
The churn rate is high at 49.2%, signaling an urgent need for retention strategies. The USA and Canada dominate in both revenue and customer base, while France and Brazil, despite high revenue, have smaller customer bases, suggesting growth opportunities. Countries like Finland, Netherlands, and Portugal contribute revenue but have few customers, indicating untapped market potential.

#### Recommendations
To address churn and growth opportunities, focus on personalized marketing and loyalty programs in high churn areas, enhance service quality through better support and user interface improvements, and expand in high-revenue but low-customer countries like France and Brazil with targeted promotions. Use advanced analytics to predict and mitigate churn, and implement regular feedback systems to continuously refine services.

# Project 4: Social Buzz

**Brief description** 
Social Buzz is a premier social media platform dedicated to connecting users with a diverse range of content, encouraging dynamic discussions and interactions. To gain a deeper understanding of user engagement and enhance the overall user experience, Social Buzz undertook a comprehensive analysis of user behavior. This analysis focused on various content categories, sentiment scores, reaction types, and content formats, aiming to uncover key insights and guide strategic improvements.

**Methodology**
- The datasets were extracted from forage.com as csv files and imported into power query for processing.
- After cleaning the data was loaded into excel for analysis using pivot tables.

#### Results 
The analysis of user behavior on Social Buzz reveals several key insights. The most popular content categories by user count are Animals (1788 users), Science (1646 users), Healthy Eating (1572 users), Technology (1557 users), and Food (1556 users). In terms of sentiment, the highest scores are found in the categories of Animals (69,624), Science (65,405), Healthy Eating (63,138), Technology (60,035), and Food (61,596). The most common user reactions are "Heart" (6.64%), "Peeking" (6.38%), "Scared" (6.34%), and "Adore" (6.17%), while the least common reactions are "Worried" and "Intrigued" (both at 5.01%).

Regarding content type preferences, users engage most with Photos (27%) and Videos (25%), followed by GIFs (25%) and Audio (23%). These results highlight the importance of certain content categories and types in driving user engagement and positive sentiment on the platform.

##### Recommendations 
To enhance user engagement and overall experience on Social Buzz, it is recommended to focus on creating and promoting content in the highly popular categories of "Animals" and "Science." Improving user reactions by addressing negative sentiments and fostering a positive environment is crucial. Prioritizing photos and videos, which have high engagement rates, while balancing with audio and GIF content will optimize content type. Additionally, leveraging user reaction data to personalize content suggestions can ensure users see more content they respond positively to, boosting satisfaction and engagement.
